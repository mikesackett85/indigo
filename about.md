<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hey everyone!  My name is Mike Sackett, welcome to my blog!  I don't want to talk about myself too much here, so I'll keep this section short and sweet.  First and foremost, I am a nerd!  I am a Linux (or GNU/Linux for those who prefer that term) and Chrome OS enthusiast, casual programmer, tech buff, and overall super nice guy.
</p>

<H3>Other Deets</H3> 
<ul>
<li>I live in upstate New York with my wife, 2 dogs, and 2 cats</li>
<li>I have a BS in Cybersecurity</li>
<li>I work as a helpdesk technician for a small firm in Syracuse, New York</li>
<li>I have been using Linux for about 8 years, and Chrome OS off-and-on for about 3 years now</li>
</ul>

<h2>About this blog</h2>

This blog is essentially a place for me to talk about various technology-related things that I find interesting, including different projects that I am working on, hardware and/or software that I am currently using or find interesting, as well as software and hardware reviews and tutorials.  

<h2>The Hardware</h2>

<p>My current hardware collection consists of my trusty 2013 Chromebook Pixel and a Raspberry Pi Model B.  I am also currently working on purchasing parts for my very first PC build (I know, what kind of self-respecting nerd hasn't built a PC before, right?!), which I will discuss in future blog posts, and add to this section as well once the build is complete.</p>
