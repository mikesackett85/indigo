<p>Hello!  My name is Mike Sackett, I am learning how to hack so that I can do my part to help make the web a safer place!  I recently earned my B.S. in Cybersecurity and currently work as a Helpdesk Technician for a small firm in Syracuse, New York.  I am hoping to someday break into the exciting field of cyber security (easier said than done), am currently working towards my Security+ certification, and have enrolled in HackerOne in hopes of becoming a successful bug bounty hunter and gaining valuable experience (and hopefully earning some cash) on the side.</p>

<p>Basically, I am pretty much a nobody and there is no good reason to read my blog.  Unless of course, you are interested in doing the same thing, or you're simply in it for the lulz and are looking for someone to troll (I'll take it!).  All kidding aside, I am excited to take you all on my journey to learn the art of hacking and hope you enjoy reading about my successes and inevitable failures.</p>

<p>If you are looking for tutorials on how to hack your significant others social media accounts or your neighbors WiFi, then unfortunately, you've come to the wrong place.  This blog is strictly of the white hat variety and I will not help you with any such requests!  Remember, with great power comes great responsibility! (Spiderman quote, yes!!!)  This blog will mainly focus on my views, thought process, the tools that I use, and my findings as I learn web application hacking, though I may post other security/hacking-related material as well.</p> 

<p>If you would like to get a hold of me to tell me how much you enjoy my blog, ask me a question, give me advice, or even tell me how much of a noob I am on social media, feel free to click on the links to my social media accounts and email on my home page.</p>
