<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hello!  My name is Mike Sackett, welcome to my tech blog!  I don't want to talk about myself too much so I'll keep this section short.  First and foremost, I am a nerd! I enjoy doing nerdy things with computers, on both the hardware and software side.  I am a Linux (GNU/Linux for the anal retentive) and Chrome OS fan, and also enjoy occasionally programming when the mood strikes.</p>

<H3>Other Perts</H3> 

<ul>
<li>I have a BS in Cybersecurity</li>
<li>I live in upstate New York with my wife, 2 dogs and 2 cats.</li>
<li>I work as a helpdesk technician for a small firm in Syracuse, New York</li>
<li>Blah blah blah</li>
</ul>

<h2>About this blog</h2>

This blog is essentially a place for me to talk about different projects I am working on and my experiences while working on those projects, the hardware and software that I'm currently using, and any other technology-related topics that I find interesting. 

<p>If you would like to get a hold of me to tell me how much you enjoy my blog, ask me a question, give me advice, or even tell me how much of a noob I am on social media, feel free to click on the links to my social media accounts and email on my home page.  If you like my blog then feel free to share it with others.</p>

<h2>The Hardware</h2>

<p>My hardware collection currently consists of my trusty 2013 Chromebook Pixel and a Raspberry Pi Model B.  I have also just started purchasing parts for my very first PC build (what kind of self-respecting nerd hasn't built a PC before?), which I will discuss in future blog posts and update on here once the build is complete.</p>
